			<p>
				It's time to take back control of your data and identity. SelfKey Connect allows you to login to partnered websites with
				your Ethereum blockchain address, powered by the SelfKey Identity Wallet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike social media logins where large companies stalk your activity and sell your data, SelfKey Connect only accesses the
				information available on your computer, powered by the SelfKey Identity Wallet (Mac/Win).
			</p>
			<p>
				None of your information is stored in a centralized server vulnerable to security risks, making this a preferred way to protect
				your privacy and data.
